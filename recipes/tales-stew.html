        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all of your veggies:
            <ul>
                <li>Peel your carrots and potatoes.</li>
                <li>Cube the potatoes, dice the carrots, and dice the onion.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare your beef:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add cubed stew meat into a bowl and add: salt, pepper, paprika, and flour to the bowl. Mix thoroughly and let sit.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large pot, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the seasoned meat. Place the heat on high, and sear the meat on all sides. Remove the meat from the pot and let rest on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same large pot, add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil along with the diced onion and place on high heat. Begin to brown the onions. Once they reach a translucent/clear color, add the garlic and turn the heat to low.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the can or bottle of a dark beer, and turn the heat back up to high. Use the liquid to scrape the bottom of the pan to pick up any burnt/well-done pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the beer begins to boil, add the rest of the veggies (carrots, potatoes, and peas) along with the wine and tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat to a  medium to medium high, and add the stew meat. Add the beef broth until the ingredients are covered (you can continue to add more stock depending on how thick/thin you like your stew).
        </li>
        <li>Add herbs to taste.</li>
        <li>
            Let the stew simmer for 40-60 minutes or until all ingredients are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately or freeze for up to a week.
        </li>
    </ol>
